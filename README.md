# Full Stack School Administration

## Introduction

On this project I created full stack school administration app to manage courses. The  application provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

 The application  requires users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. 

The technologies I implemented in the application: React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.
